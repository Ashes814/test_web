    <ResearchProject subSectionTitle="Changes of Transit Usage Behavior during the Covid-19 Pandemic"
                     subSectionText="Utilizing an extensive and longitudinal smart card dataset from Jeju, South Korea, we present a suite of novel methodologies to analyze the shifting patterns of transit usage among domestic inbound visitors and local inhabitants amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Our study uncovers a long-term decay of visitorsâ€™ transit usage, hinting that inbound travelers tended to use the transit system more conservatively as the pandemic endured. For local residents, we have developed a Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCD) framework to pinpoint significant shifts in individual transit usage frequency and assess how such changes were affected by pivotal government policies, such as risk alerts, social distancing mandates, public transit policies, and the relaxation of social distancing measures. Our findings indicate that only a subset of these policies had a marked influence. Specifically, the implementation of risk alerts would cause a surge of 277% to 317% in the number of individuals reducing their use of public transit. Conversely, the relaxation of social distancing measures was associated with a 134% to 155% rise in the number of users who increased their travel frequency."

A collection of regression models is introduced to quantify the dynamic effects of local and national COVID-19 indicators on their travel behavior. Results suggest that behavior of inbound travelers was jointly affected by pandemic severity locally and remotely. The impacts of the pandemic did not diminish over time but produced heterogeneous effects on travels with different trip purposes."
